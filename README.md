RocketChat install wizard

------------

Get a PAT token in RocketChat. Log in as the admin user, click on the "A" icon in the top left corner, "My Account" and then "Personal Access Token". Set authentication to ignore two factor authentication and call it 'workshop'. Generate a new token and copy the user and token.
